### King Classic 2018
Every year friends and family endure a three day, two-rounds-per day golf trip and claim they have fun. To make life easier on the scorekeepers, a Flask web application hosted on AWS has been created to automatically keep score and calculate side game winnings. Is this absolutely necessary? No. But it was a bunch of fun creating the site, and now anyone can keep up with real-time results. Cruise on over to [kingclassicgolf.com](http://www.kingclassicgolf.com/) to check out the site.
